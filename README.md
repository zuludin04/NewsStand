# News Stand
News Stand is my personal peroject to test and try Android new development feature Composeable.
After doing some research, I was really interested with this framework because it reminds me of Flutter.
After some time here's my take for this framework:

Pros
- It really is like Flutter, so if you have experienced in Flutter before this framework pretty easy to understand
- You don't have to create Adapter to populate List of data, so no extra work
- There'is Preview when create new view, same like XML Editor but you can interact with it
- Pretty easy to create complicated UI
- Easily create custom view because you don't have to tied your code into your XML

Cons
-
